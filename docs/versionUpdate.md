# Version Updates

## 2024/11/14
1. **Move the pre-compiled executables in GitHub release**: We have moved the pre-compiled executables to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/HuangLab-SYSU/block-emulator/releases).
2. **Debug**: We have fixed a bug in the `AddAccounts` function in the `./chain/blockchain.go` file. The function previously threw a null pointer exception if no new tree nodes were added to the MPT after it was accessed and updated. To resolve this, we added a check to verify whether the newNodeSet is nil. **If you are interested in the cause of this bug, you can refer to the following: [AddAccount nil pointer](./IssueLogs/addaccount_nil_pointer_dir/addaccount_nil_pointer.md)**

## 2024/11/05
1. **A new document**: We have committed an issue log document on GitHub. [Issue Log](./issueLogRoot.md). 

## 2024/10/29
1. **Debug**: We found that the shardNum in `main.go` cannot affect the `params.ShardNum`. This bug originated from the updates made on 2024/09/01 and led to incorrect CLPA results. **The bug has now been fixed.**
2. **Debug**: When setting the shardNum as 1 and using the CLPA consensus, the supervisor node will enter a dead loop. **Now the CLPA parition algorithm will not be triggered when `shardNum` is 1.**
3. **A new method to control blocksize**: Now users can use datasize (in bytes) to control the size of a block, instead of the number of transactions. In `paramsConfig.json`, users can set `UseBlocksizeInBytes` as `1` to enable this method and specify `BlocksizeInBytes` to limit the size of block.

## 2024/09/01
1. **An IP Table**: A file named ./ipTable.json is provided for IP configuration. Users may modify the IP addresses of the nodes as needed. Please note that the first-level key in this JSON file is "ShardID", and the second-level key is "NodeID".
2. **Params Configuration File**: Users can define various parameters in the ./paramsConfig.json file, including ConsensusMethod, ExpDataRootDir, DatasetFile, and others.
3. **View Change for a single shard**: The view change mechanism for a single shard is updated. Because of the complexity of cross-shard communications, we only provide this mechanism for only one shard now. 

## 2024/07/19
1. **A Chinese version of the user manual**: We provide a Chinese version of the user manual, allowing users to quickly get started with **blockEmulator**.

2. **3 Python code examples for plotting**. Users can view the plotting graphs of results by running the Python code located in the ```./figurePlot``` folder.

## 2024/07/12
1. **More details on testing metrics**: We have added more detailed testing metrics for the blockchain operation process, allowing users to observe the blockchain system with more granular data. Metrics can be seen in `params.DataWrite_path` that is re-defined in `main.go`. 

## 2024/07/10
1. **User-defined experimental data output directory**: We have introduced a feature that allows users to customize the output directory for experimental data. Users can specify this directory via the command line using the `-d` or `--dataRootDir` options.

    Here are 2 examples: 

    ```
    1) go run main.go -g -d TestDir
    2) go run main.go -n 1 -N 4 -s 3 -S 4 -m 3 --dataRootDir TestDir 
    ```

## 2024/07/06
1. **Executable Files**: We have added **precompiled executable files** for **blockEmulator**. With these executables, users can run the precompiled files *without having Golang installed or downloading the required libraries*. The **scripts** for compiling Golang code into executable files are located in the ``./zPrecompileScripts`` folder. 

2. **Run Executable Files**: The executable files for the three operating systems are as follows:
    - **Windows**: ``./blockEmulator_Windows_Precompile.exe``
    - **Linux**: ``./blockEmulator_Linux_Precompile``
    - **MacOS**: ``./blockEmulator_MacOS_Precompile``

- Users can use these executables to generate a **batch script for the executable** (for example, on Windows):
```./blockEmulator_Windows_Precompile.exe -S 2 -N 4 -m 0 -g --shellForExe```

- Here, `--shellForExe` indicates generating a batch script for the **executable**.
    
- Then, the `WinExe_bat_shardNum=2_NodeNum=4_mod=CLPA_Broker.bat` file will generated, users can run this `.bat` file on the Windows OS. 

3. **Compatibility**: This update will **not affect** existing code.


## 2024/07/01
1. **Modified Dataset**：We have substituted the provided dataset ``./TestTx_1M.csv`` with ``./selectedTxs_300K.csv``. Transactions in the new dataset are curated from real-world historical Ethereum transactions. Algorithms reliant on historical transaction data are anticipated to demonstrate improved performance with this updated dataset.

## 2024/06/12
1. **Fine-tune Lock**: The source codes of **Fine-tune Lock**(INFOCOM'24) has been added to the branch **Fine-tune Lock**. 

## 2024/06/11 
1. **Bug Fixed**: Fixed some bugs in the PBFT consensus, which could cause PBFT consensus nodes to discard early arriving messages in cases of unstable network latency.

## 2024/05/20
1. **New Dataset**：Users can take experiments on a test dataset ``./TestTx_1M.csv``.

## 2024/03/01
1. **FAQ Added**: We have added the **[*FAQ.md*](https://github.com/HuangLab-SYSU/block-emulator/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md)**

## 2023/12/12
1. **New Features**: We have added the *shell generator function* in *Linux*. 
- When users use the command 
`go run main.go -g ` to
 generate the *.bat* file for *Windows*, a *.shell* file will be generated, too.

## 2023/07/21
**Problem**: The account transferring led to the slight disorganization of txpool. 
- **Reason**: The algorithm saved the cost, but mixed up the txpool. 
- **Solution**: We rewrite the algorithm so that it can keep the order of txpool with a small cost. 

## 2023/07/18
**Problem**: The TCP connection will report err if the number of shards or nodes is too large.   
- **Reason**: The TCP connection is implemented as a *short connection*, which results in too many simultaneous connections due to TCP's wait_close time delaying the closing of the TCP connection. 
- **Solution1**: We solved the problem by changing the *short connection* to *long connection*, which will not build or close tcp connection frequently.
- **Solution2**: Users can split the commands and run blockEmulator on different PCs, and the relevant IP settings can be modified in *params/global_config.go* and *build/build.go*. 

## 2023/06/22
Debugs:
1. **Problem**: The PBFT consensus will interrupt in a large-scale experiment (large-size data & a number of shards).   
- **Reason**: The implementation of the func *HandleforSequentialRequest* and *HandleforSequentialRequest* has bugs, which can result in laggards not being able to get old PBFT messages. 
- **Solution**: We solved the logic errors in the func, and now the function can operate correctly. 

## 2023/05/25
1. **New Features**: We have added query function. 
- After the experiment is completed, users can query the account balance now. 
- After the experiment is completed, users can query the information of blocks and transactions on the blockchain now. 

## 2023/05/24
1. Future work of [**2023/05/21 Debugs - 1**](#20230521)
- 2023/05/21: **Future**: We will solve this problem without "Virtual transactions", because this implementation cost more.
- Now this function *blockChain.AddAccount* can operate correctly without invoking *GetUpdateStatusTrie* (the resource cost is reduced). 

## 2023/05/21
Debugs:
1. **Problem**: The function *blockChain.AddAccount* has no effect on the storage.  
- **Reason**: The implementation of this func cannot change the Merkle root...
- **Solution**: We use "Virtual transactions" to replace the *AddAccount* operation. For a just added account, we consider it as a virtual transaction (whose *Sender* or *Recipient* is "00000000000000"), so that we can use *GetUpdateStatusTrie* to do this operation. 
- **Future**: We will solve this problem without "Virtual transactions", because this implementation costs more.

2. **Problem**: The transactions migrate to the incorrect shard (in CLPA + Broker mechanism)
- **Reason**: The judge function is incorrect, leading to the wrong behaviors. 
- **Solution**: We have added a new attribute *SenderIsBroker* in broker tx, to identify whether the sender is a broker account (if *HasBroker && !SenderIsBroker* is true, then the *recipient* is a broker account), and modified the *sendAccounts_and_Txs* function in *accountTransfermod_Broker.go* file with this attribute. 

## 2023/05/19
Debugs: 
1. **Problem**: The init_balances of some accounts were wrong.  
- **Reason**: The init_balances were set by shallow copy ("="), but *Balance* is a pointer (*big.Int)
- **Solution**: We have replaced the shallow copy with a deep copy (with an "adding-zero" form)
